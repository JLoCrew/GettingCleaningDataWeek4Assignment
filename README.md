# GettingCleaningDataWeek4Assignment
Coursera Getting and Cleaning data Week 4 Assignment

To fulfill requirements of Week 4's assignment, I have applied learnings to do the following:
a) download and unzip file
b) use cbind and rbind functions to augment files
c) use grepl function to select relevant columns by column headings
d) use merge function to look up and append a new column by using a primary key
e) use melt and cast functions to create aggregate function by groups of variables

Please see my .R file for actual codes, CodeBook.md for descriptions of the variables, and the .txt file for output tidied data file
