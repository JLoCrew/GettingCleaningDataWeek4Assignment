The primary keys in the data files are:
  SubjectID
  ActivityID
  
The variables kept are those that include the characters of "mean" or "std" in the column headings:
 "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"

The variable that was looked up and appended as a new column is as such:
  ActivityType
  
The original data sources are from the 'test' and 'train' files

The transformations done include the following:
a) appending the test and train files with the SubjectID that are found in the subject file
b) appending the test and train files with column headings that are found in the Y files
c) augment the test and train files using rbind
d) select attributes by column headings; specifically, those that contain "mean" and "std"
e) Calculate mean of each attribute by combination of SubjectID and ActivityID
